# logoOverVoice
A rough mashup of google speech recognition and logo (python turtle implementation of the once-popular toy programming language). It allows for a few predefined voice commands to be executed. To choose the command set (language), find the line:
```python
lang = 'en-us'
```
in turtle-gfx.py and give it a matching file name (bar extension) from the ./commands folder.
